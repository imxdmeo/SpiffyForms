<!-- This is the template file for the main application page.  The first 
     step here is to add some elements with special IDs we'll bind to later.
     Each on of these elements will get a dynamic control added to it in
     src/main/java/org.spiffyui.spiffyforms/client/Index.java.

	                            will be displayed --> 

  <h2 class="sectionTitle">There should be a Grid under me!</h2>
